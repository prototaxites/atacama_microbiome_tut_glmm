# What is a linear model?

* Real data is noisy - there's lots of variation

* There's not just one line you can draw through the data

* Linear models - a statistical approach to finding the line that fits the data best

x <- 1:20
c <- 6
b <- 1.5

df <- data.frame(x = x, y = y)
```

# Where does this variation come from?

.pull-left[
<br/>
1. There's a variable we haven't considered

2. Bias or error in measurements

3. Genetic or environmental variation between individuals

We account for this using the normal distribution:

# Building a linear model

$$y_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} x + \varepsilon$$
$$ \varepsilon \sim Normal(0, \sigma^{2}) $$
<br/><br/>
Here:
* $y$ is our response variable - what are we trying to understand?

* $\beta_0$ is the intercept - the value of $y$ when $x = 0$ 

* $\beta_1$ is the effect of $x$ on $y$ - the number of units $y$ increases per unit increase in $x$

* $\varepsilon$ is a normal distribution, centred on zero, with a width determined by $\sigma^2$

# Populations and groups

#### Often in biology - things more similar than you would expect!

   - chicks in nests - genetically related, same environment
   
   - fields in a landscape - plants in a field are more similar due to shared environment
   
--
<br/>

#### Use population and group effects (also known as fixed and random effects)

  - Population effects describe what happens to the average field
  
  - Group effects describe what happens to specific fields
  
--
<br/>

#### R formula often looks like this:

.center[
`y ~ Var1 + Var2 + (Var1 + Var2 | Group)`
]

# Linear models - putting it all together
<br/>
<br/>

####  We have the basis for linear models - they are composed of parameters and variables

#### Multiply the variables by the parameters and add all the terms together to produce a prediction

#### We have an estimate of the error, $\varepsilon$, which tells us how dispersed around our model the data are

#### Finally, we can account for variation among groups using group effects

---

# Using linear models for community data

* Normally, community data is represented with one row per sample, and one column for each species

* The value in a cell is the presence/absence or abundance of that species on that sample

```{r eval=TRUE}
dune <- rownames_to_column(dune, "Sample")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(head(dune[,c(1:7)]))
```

---

# Using linear models for community data

* To make linear models for community data, we have to have one row per species per sample:

```{r eval=TRUE}
dune <- pivot_longer(dune, !Sample, names_to = "Species", 
             values_to = "Abundance")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(dune[c(1:3, 31:33, 61:63),])
```

---

# Using linear models for community data

* Then we can attach the sample-level environmental data

```{r eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
dune.env <- rownames_to_column(dune.env, "Sample")
dune <- left_join(dune, dune.env)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
kable(dune[c(1:3, 121:123, 301:303),c(1:3, 4, 6:7)])
```

---

# Using linear models for community data
<br/>

#### Using the data in this format, we can build a model to explain the drivers of community composition

#### Our response variable is the abundance of species $i$ on sample $j$

#### We fit population effects, as well as group effects for each species

  - The population effects describe the response of the "average" species
  
  - The group effects describe how each individual species responds

### These models are complex (lots of parameters!)

### Can be hard for the computer to fit

## Using Bayesian statistical methods helps!

---

# Bayesian statistics - a quick primer

* Bayesian statistics is a philosophy of statistics in which everything is treated as a "random variable" (i.e. everything has a probability distribution)

--

* Because everything has a probability distribution, we must specify a *prior* distribution for each parameter in our model

--

* The result of the model is the *posterior* distribution, which combines the "likelihood" of the data with the *prior* distribution

# Bayesian statistics - MCMC

#### Bayesian statistics are analytically hard to solve for anything except simple models - can use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in order to approximate the answer

  - (this takes a long time...)

#### MCMC is an algorithm that "samples" from the posterior distribution

# Putting it all together - using a Bayesian linear model to analyse microbiome data

* The dataset we are going to analyse is of the Atacama desert soil microbiome - it's one of the QIIME2 tutorial datasets

* The data comes from the paper "Signiﬁcant Impacts of Increasing Aridity on the Arid Soil Microbiome" by Nielson et al. (2017) - [https://doi.org/10.1128/mSystems.00195-16](https://doi.org/10.1128/mSystems.00195-16)

* The study was a metabarcoding survey of desert soils from two transects across the Atacama desert in Chile, looking at how soil aridity affects microbiome composition

# Atacama desert microbiome

* Authors measured a number of environmental variables at each site, including: 

  - elevation, soil humidity, soil temperature, soil electrical conductance, and vegetation cover
  
* The authors hypothesise:  
  
> *"We hypothesize that in arid ecosystems, regions of higher aridity correlate with decreased microbial taxonomic richness and significant changes in phylogenetic composition.*

* Can we demonstrate this using a Bayesian linear model?

# Atacama desert microbiome - data preprocessing

1. Microbiome sequences processed using QIIME2

  - demultiplexed
  
  - features identified using dada2
  
  - taxonomically classified using naive Bayes classifier trained on the Silva database
  
2. There was some missing data in the sample metadata, so I imputed values using the R package *mice*

# Atacama desert microbiome - taxonomy
<br/>
<br/>

#### Two ways to explore the effects of taxonomy

  - We can take our best estimate for the response of each species to elevation and plot them by taxonomy

  - We can build models that include additional group effects for each taxonomic level of interest

# Extending these models

#### These Bayesian linear models can be extended a lot further

* Estimate repeatability of sampling of the microbial community from individuals

* Similarly, estimate heritability of microbial community

* Include multiple taxonomic levels in the model

* Can transform the turnover components into measures of $\beta$ diversity such as Jaccard's index

* Incorporate spatial autocorrelation using Bayesian spatial modelling software such as *R-INLA*
